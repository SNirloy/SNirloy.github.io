Hello, world!
It is I, Sadi Nirloy, here to grace this world with my site. 
Since much of my experience in programming is algorithms, I do not have anything to show off, so here we are.
This doubles as my website practice, though this will probably be very rudimentary.
This triples as a collection of my knowledge in case I ever forget something, or donk my head. I do hope plan on organizing this in a tutorial style, building CS as a subject from the ground up. I want this to be a decent resource for someone to pick up programming, even though I am currently limited to just text, and maybe some images.
Thank you for reading this quaint Readme.md, and please head on over to the index.html.
